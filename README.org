* Modus Operandi Emacs

Modus Operandi Emacs is a project that aims to deliver a robust and fast development environment. It
supports various programming languages and file formats by utilizing relevant language servers and
modes.

This is my continually evolving Emacs configuration. I recommend drawing inspiration from it and
adapting it to your own needs.

** Emacs Version
This configuration is intended to be used only on Emacs 29 built with tree-sitter support. I
strongly recommend using Emacs builds with native compilation enabled. In addition, I discourage
builds with pgtk enabled for now, as it seems to negatively impact performance in some scenarios
(e.g. corfu auto completion).

*** Compiling Emacs 29
Until Emacs 29 is officially released, I recommend building it yourself.

Clone Emacs 29 branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone -b emacs-29 --single-branch https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
#+END_SRC

On Debian based distros:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt build-dep emacs
sudo apt install libtree-sitter-dev
#+END_SRC

On Redhat based distros:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo dnf builddep emacs
sudo dnf install libtree-sitter-devel
#+END_SRC

Inside the cloned repo, build Emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-dbus --with-gif --with-jpeg --with-png --with-rsvg --with-tiff --with-xft --with-xpm --with-x-toolkit=lucid --with-gpm=no --with-modules --with-harfbuzz --with-cairo --with-json --with-native-compilation --with-tree-sitter
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies
You should have the following software installed:
1. [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] - like grep, but faster
2. [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]] - like find, but faster
3. [[https://github.com/GNUAspell/aspell][aspell]] - for spell check
4. [[https://github.com/Kitware/CMake][cmake]] - for compiling vterm
5. [[https://direnv.net][direnv]] - for managing environment variables based on current directory

Additional software might be needed based on usage. Follow *Messages* buffer for details.

** Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/manzaltu/modus-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Optionally, you can install [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][chemacs2]] and use this configuration alongside others.

** Personalized Settings
You can create a file named personal.el in your Emacs folder and add personalized settings. For
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; personal.el --- Personal configuration file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This is a personal configuration file

;;; Code:

;; Personal info
(setq user-full-name "Some Name"
      user-mail-address "user@domain.example")

;; Set font
(set-frame-font  "PragmataPro Mono Liga-16" nil t)

;;; personal.el ends here
#+END_SRC

** Getting updates
You can update the configuration by running the following command inside the cloned dir:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git pull -r
#+END_SRC
